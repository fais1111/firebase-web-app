/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows full access to all data for prototyping purposes.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of several top-level collections: `users`, `accident_reports`, `admin_locations`, `accident_guides`, `therapists`, `appointments`, `mental_health_resources`, `cyber_security_incidents`, `disaster_reports`, `sos_reports`, `safe_zones`, `resources`, and `news_and_updates`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All read and write operations are allowed for all users, including unauthenticated users.
